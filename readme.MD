Comcast-Business-Blaster

A real simple utility that uses a dictionary attack against a Comcast business web login.  I built this to test the Comcast login at work and have only used this against two targets so all other testing and feedback is appreciated.

I would like to make this a simple one line utility when I get a chance, ie: ccblaster.py <ip_target> <user_list> <password_list>
